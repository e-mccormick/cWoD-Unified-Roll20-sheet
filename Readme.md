This is a WIP [Classic World of Darkness](https://wiki.roll20.net/Classic_World_of_Darkness) character sheet for Roll20, with option for several games(Vampire, Wherewolf, Mage etc.) in a single sheet. Most recent changes are to generalize it more, change it from dots to numbers, make the diplayed sheet narrower on the screen, and allow for varriang levels of technology.

Original creator: [@CoalPoweredPuppet](https://github.com/CoalPoweredPuppet) and then forked by [@Anduh](https://github.com/Anduh/cWoD-Unified-Roll20-sheet). And then I took it to make an even more generic sheet using unifoed rules developed by a gaming group in Korea and later the USA to generalize it more for custom games, like an adaption of Fantasy Games Unlimited Inc.'s Space Opera to something with less skills and more than just psionics. In other words, we brought magic, vampires, and more to space based cmpaigns for futuristic settings.

We have also found errors in the init, hit, and damage systems that needed adjusting. Adventure! has been added with the other books in that universe, and the goal has been to make it far more universal.
